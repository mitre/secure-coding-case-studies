# Case Study: CVE-2025-60010  
**Password-Aging Bypass in Junos OS / Junos OS Evolved**

## 1. Title  
Password-Aging Bypass in Junos OS / Junos OS Evolved — Expired Passwords Accepted by RADIUS Client (CVE-2025-60010)

---
 
## 2. Introduction  
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) dictionary catalogs publicly known security weaknesses.  
CVE-2025-60010 is a medium-severity vulnerability affecting Juniper Networks’ Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved.  
The flaw allows users with *expired passwords* to still authenticate successfully when RADIUS authentication is used.  
This undermines enterprise password-aging policies and can allow prolonged unauthorized access.

---

## 3. Software  
Affected software includes:

- **Junos OS**
  - Versions before:
    - 22.4R3-S8  
    - 23.2R2-S4  
    - 23.4R2-S5  
    - 24.2R2-S1  
    - 24.4R1-S3, 24.4R2  

- **Junos OS Evolved**
  - Versions prior to corresponding patched EVO releases.

These platforms are used on Juniper routers, switches, and network devices.

---

## 4. Weakness (CWE)  
CVE-2025-60010 maps to:

- **CWE-262 — Not Using Password Aging**

The weakness lies in the incorrect handling of expired-password responses from RADIUS.  
Even when a RADIUS server indicates that a password has expired, Junos fails to enforce a mandatory reset.

---

## 5. Vulnerability  
When an expired password is used during RADIUS authentication:

1. The RADIUS server rejects the login and requests a forced password change.  
2. However, Junos OS will *still* allow the user to authenticate if they entered the correct (but expired) password.  
3. This results in **password-aging bypass**, weakening security controls intended to force periodic credential updates.

This does not grant unauthorized access to users without credentials—but it does allow old passwords to remain active indefinitely.

---

## 6. Exploit  
### Attack Requirements
- Attacker must already know the user’s correct (but expired) password.
- Access attempt occurs through a device using RADIUS authentication.

### Attack Vector
- Network-based login attempt (CVSS vector: **AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N**).

### Impact
- Users can continue logging in indefinitely without updating their expired credentials.
- Enables persistence, policy evasion, and potential lateral movement within enterprise networks.
- No publicly known exploit code is required; exploitation consists simply of logging in normally.

---

## 7. Fix  
Juniper released security patches that correctly enforce password expiration:

- Update to **22.4R3-S8**, **23.2R2-S4**, **23.4R2-S5**, **24.2R2-S1**, **24.4R1-S3/24.4R2**, or later.
- Junos OS Evolved users must update to corresponding patched EVO versions.

Organizations should apply updates immediately and verify compliance using internal patch-management tools.

---

## 8. Prevention  
To reduce risk and prevent similar issues:

- **Apply official vendor patches** as soon as possible.  
- **Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA)** to reduce dependence on passwords.  
- **Improve logging and monitoring** for authentications from expired accounts.  
- **Audit RADIUS policies and responses** regularly.  
- **Implement identity lifecycle management**, including automatic deactivation of stale accounts.  
- Use **defense-in-depth controls**, such as access privilege limits and network segmentation.

---

## 9. Conclusion  
CVE-2025-60010 demonstrates how a subtle authentication logic flaw can undermine a fundamental security policy—password rotation.  
While the vulnerability does not allow login with incorrect credentials, it **bypasses password-expiration enforcement**, creating long-term access risk.  
Patch application and strong authentication practices are essential for mitigating this vulnerability across Junos OS environments.
